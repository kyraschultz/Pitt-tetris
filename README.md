# Pitt-tetris
## A fun twist on the classic arcade game tetris
This game is an attempt for me to recreate tetris using python and pygame, but with the blocks being buildings at the University of Pittsburgh. H2P! 

Blocks:
- The Cathedral of Learning 
- Hillman Library
- Posvar Hall
- William Pitt Union
- Benedum Hall
